# Attendance at sporting events
The theme chosen for the EDA consists of attendance at sporting events in the countries of the European Union (EU). This topic was selected, since always being linked to the world of sports, I wanted to understand what are the reasons that condition attendance or not at these events.

The business of sport depends on the volume of spectators that elite competitions attract. The European Union (EU) is one of the largest markets in this segment after the United States, but attendance at sporting events is uneven throughout Europe.

From knowing which theme was going to work, we proceeded to search for information that provides useful data for the study.

Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, plotly express, seaborn libraries were used.
